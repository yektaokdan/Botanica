This project presents a unique Android application designed for nature enthusiasts who love to capture and document the beauty of the outdoors. As users explore various natural landscapes, they encounter fascinating flora and waterfalls, among other natural wonders. This app provides a platform for users to take photos of these discoveries, annotate them with names, locations, and dates, and save this information for future reference or sharing with a community of like-minded individuals. Developed using Kotlin language and Android Studio, this application leverages CoreData for data persistence, ensuring that users can keep a detailed record of their nature encounters.

Interactive User Interface: The app features a user-friendly interface equipped with gesture recognizers for intuitive navigation and interaction. Users can easily navigate through their saved entries or add new ones.
Enhanced Navigation: With the implementation of a Navigation Controller, users enjoy seamless transitions between different sections of the app, enhancing the overall user experience.
Picker Integration: The app incorporates pickers for selecting dates and locations, making the data entry process smoother and more user-friendly.
Easy Data Sharing: Through the use of segues, users can effortlessly move between different views within the app, enabling easy sharing and viewing of their nature diaries.
